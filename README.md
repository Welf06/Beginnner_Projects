# Beginnner_Projects
This repo contains all the small as well as beginner level projects.
This repo mostly contains projects in Python as it was my first language.

### Inspiration:
Having a repo containing all the projects I started out with, would serve as a benchmark to how far
I have come, apart from being nostalagic of course/

### What is next:
I would continue to add projects to this repo, which I feel are too beginner level or small to have their own repo
